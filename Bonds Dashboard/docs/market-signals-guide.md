# Bond Market Signals Interpretation Guide

## Introduction: Understanding the Bond Dashboard

This guide explains how twelve bond market metrics are transformed into five actionable market signals. The dashboard is designed to help interpret what's happening in bond markets and the broader economy by synthesizing multiple data points into clear, interpretable insights.

### The 12 Bond Market Metrics

**Yield Metrics:**
1. **2Y Treasury Yield** - Short-term rate expectations
2. **10Y Treasury Yield** - Benchmark rate, growth/inflation balance  
3. **30Y Treasury Yield** - Long-term economic expectations

**Curve Metrics:**
4. **10Y-2Y Spread** - Classic recession indicator
5. **30Y-10Y Spread** - Long-term growth expectations

**Market Context:**
6. **S&P 500** - Risk asset performance
7. **VIX** - Market fear gauge
8. **Dollar Index** - Global demand for USD assets

**Rate Metrics:**
9. **Fed Funds Rate** - Current policy rate
10. **SOFR** - Short-term funding rate

**Credit Metrics:**
11. **IG Credit Spreads** - Investment grade stress
12. **HY Credit Spreads** - High yield/junk bond stress

### The 5 Market Signals

1. **Economic Outlook** - What the bond market expects for growth
2. **Risk Environment** - Current stress and risk appetite levels
3. **Policy & Rates Direction** - Where interest rates are headed
4. **Bond Market Stress** - Warning signs specific to fixed income
5. **Inflation Expectations** - What markets expect for future inflation

### How Metrics Feed Into Signals

**Economic Outlook Signal**
- Primary inputs: 2Y, 10Y, 30Y yields + Both curve spreads
- Why: The yield curve shape is the bond market's expression of growth expectations. Steeper curves suggest growth, flat/inverted suggest slowdown

**Risk Environment Signal**
- Primary inputs: IG spreads, HY spreads, VIX, S&P 500
- Why: Credit spreads widen when investors demand more compensation for risk. Combined with equity volatility, this shows overall risk appetite

**Policy & Rates Direction Signal**
- Primary inputs: Fed Funds, SOFR, 2Y yield, 10Y yield
- Why: Short rates reflect Fed policy, while 2Y yields show market expectations. The gap reveals if markets agree with the Fed

**Bond Market Stress Signal**
- Primary inputs: Extreme readings in spreads, curve inversions, Dollar spikes, VIX elevation
- Why: This signal specifically looks for combinations that historically precede bond market dislocations

**Inflation Expectations Signal**
- Primary inputs: 10Y yield, 30Y yield, curve steepness, Fed Funds vs long yields
- Why: Long-term yields embed inflation expectations. Steep curves suggest higher future inflation

## Detailed Signal Interpretations

### 1. Economic Outlook Signal

**What it measures**: Bond market's economic growth expectations over the next 6-18 months

**Key Thresholds**:
- **Strong Growth**: 10Y-2Y > 150bps, 30Y-10Y > 50bps
- **Moderate Growth**: 10Y-2Y 50-150bps, 30Y-10Y 20-50bps  
- **Slowdown**: 10Y-2Y 0-50bps, 30Y-10Y 0-20bps
- **Recession Risk**: 10Y-2Y < 0 (inverted)
- **Deep Recession**: 10Y-2Y < -50bps

**Interpretation Logic**:
- Steepening curves = Growth expectations rising
- Flattening curves = Growth concerns building
- Inverted curves = Recession expected within 12-18 months
- Consider both spreads: If 10Y-2Y inverted but 30Y-10Y steep, recession expected to be short

**Key Phrases**:
- "Yield curve remains positively sloped at X bps, suggesting continued expansion"
- "Curve inversion at -X bps historically signals recession within 12-18 months"
- "Long-end steepening despite short-end inversion suggests recession expectations are for a short downturn"

### 2. Risk Environment Signal

**What it measures**: Overall market stress levels and investor risk appetite

**Key Thresholds**:
- **Risk-On**: IG < 80bps, HY < 300bps, VIX < 15
- **Balanced**: IG 80-120bps, HY 300-450bps, VIX 15-20
- **Cautious**: IG 120-150bps, HY 450-600bps, VIX 20-25
- **Risk-Off**: IG > 150bps, HY > 600bps, VIX > 25
- **Stress**: IG > 200bps, HY > 800bps, VIX > 35

**Interpretation Logic**:
- Credit spreads are the clearest risk indicator in bond markets
- IG spreads lead HY spreads in signaling stress
- VIX confirms but can diverge (watch for this)
- S&P 500 performance provides context

**Key Phrases**:
- "Credit markets remain calm with IG spreads at X bps"
- "Risk aversion building as credit spreads widen to X/Y bps"
- "Despite equity volatility, credit markets remain constructive"

### 3. Policy & Rates Direction Signal

**What it measures**: Federal Reserve policy trajectory and market expectations

**Key Thresholds**:
- **Easing Expected**: 2Y yield < Fed Funds - 50bps
- **Cuts Priced**: 2Y yield < Fed Funds  
- **Neutral**: 2Y yield ≈ Fed Funds (±25bps)
- **Hikes Priced**: 2Y yield > Fed Funds
- **Aggressive Tightening**: 2Y yield > Fed Funds + 50bps

**Interpretation Logic**:
- 2Y yields lead Fed Funds by 6-12 months
- SOFR-Fed Funds spread shows funding stress
- 10Y movements confirm or challenge 2Y signals
- Large gaps suggest market disagrees with Fed

**Key Phrases**:
- "Markets pricing X bps of cuts over next 12 months"
- "2Y yields at X% suggest Fed will hike to Y%"  
- "Wide gap between 2Y and Fed Funds indicates market expects policy pivot"

### 4. Bond Market Stress Signal

**What it measures**: Specific warning signs of bond market dysfunction

**Red Flags to Monitor**:
- Curve inversion > 50bps
- IG spreads > 150bps with widening momentum
- Dollar Index spikes > 2% in a week
- VIX > 30 with bond volatility also elevated
- SOFR-Fed Funds spread > 10bps
- 30Y yields falling while 2Y rising (bull flattening in risk-off)

**Stress Levels**:
- **Normal**: No red flags
- **Monitoring**: 1-2 red flags
- **Warning**: 3-4 red flags  
- **Stress**: 5+ red flags
- **Crisis**: All indicators flashing red

**Key Phrases**:
- "Bond market functioning normally with no stress indicators"
- "Warning signs emerging: [specific indicators]"
- "Multiple stress indicators suggest bond market dysfunction risk"

### 5. Inflation Expectations Signal

**What it measures**: What bond markets expect for future inflation

**Key Thresholds**:
- **Deflation Risk**: 10Y < 2%, 30Y < 2.5%
- **Low Inflation**: 10Y 2-3%, 30Y 2.5-3.5%
- **Normal**: 10Y 3-4.5%, 30Y 3.5-5%
- **Elevated**: 10Y 4.5-5.5%, 30Y 5-6%
- **High Inflation**: 10Y > 5.5%, 30Y > 6%

**Interpretation Logic**:
- Absolute yield levels matter for inflation
- Curve steepness shows inflation acceleration/deceleration
- Compare long yields to Fed Funds for real rate assessment
- Rapid yield rises = inflation fears; rapid falls = growth fears

**Key Phrases**:
- "10Y yields at X% imply moderate inflation expectations"
- "Steepening long end suggests rising inflation expectations"
- "Despite Fed at X%, long yields at Y% show inflation concerns remain"

## Implementation Guidelines

### Signal Generation Process

1. **Calculate Primary Metrics**: Pull current values for all inputs
2. **Compare to Thresholds**: Determine which regime each signal is in
3. **Assess Rate of Change**: Note if metrics are moving rapidly
4. **Check for Divergences**: Flag when signals contradict
5. **Generate Text**: Create clear, specific interpretations

### Confidence Levels

**High Confidence**: 
- All inputs for a signal align
- Clear threshold breaches
- Confirmed by multiple timeframes

**Moderate Confidence**:
- Most inputs align
- Near threshold levels
- Some minor divergences

**Low Confidence**:
- Mixed signals within a category
- Rapid changes making interpretation difficult
- Major divergences present

### Key Principles

1. **Be Specific**: Always include actual numbers, not just direction
2. **Show Change**: Reference how metrics have moved, not just levels
3. **Flag Divergences**: When credit says one thing but rates say another
4. **Provide Context**: Compare to historical norms and recent ranges
5. **Clear Language**: Avoid jargon, explain what it means for bonds/economy

### Example Signal Output

**Economic Outlook: SLOWDOWN WARNING**
*Confidence: High*

"The 10Y-2Y spread has flattened to just 23 bps from 67 bps last month, approaching inversion territory. While not yet inverted, this rapid flattening combined with the 30Y-10Y spread compression to 31 bps suggests bond markets are pricing in significant economic deceleration over the next 12 months. Historical patterns show curves this flat precede recessions by 6-12 months approximately 70% of the time."
