## 🔧 Environment Variables You Need

For any cloud platform, you'll need these environment variables:

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `VITE_FRED_API_KEY` | Your FRED API key | Get from [research.stlouisfed.org/useraccount/apikey](https://research.stlouisfed.org/useraccount/apikey) |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Enables production optimizations |
| `PORT` | (auto-set by platform) | Platform will set this automatically |

## 📱 Getting Your FRED API Key

1. Go to [https://research.stlouisfed.org/useraccount/apikey](https://research.stlouisfed.org/useraccount/apikey)
2. Create a free account
3. Request an API key
4. Copy the key for use in environment variables

## 🚀 Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test these URLs:

1. **Health Check**: `https://your-app-url.com/api/health`
2. **Main App**: `https://your-app-url.com`
3. **API Test**: `https://your-app-url.com/api/fred/series/DGS10` (10-year Treasury)

## 📱 Accessing from Your Phone

Once deployed:

1. **Open your mobile browser** (Safari, Chrome, etc.)
2. **Navigate to your deployed URL**
3. **Add to Home Screen** for easy access:
   - **iPhone**: Tap Share → Add to Home Screen
   - **Android**: Tap Menu → Add to Home Screen

Your dashboard will work like a native app! 📱

## 🔄 Automatic Updates

**Railway & Render**: Automatically redeploy when you push to GitHub
**Vercel**: Also automatically redeploys on GitHub pushes

To update your app:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update dashboard"
git push
```

Your changes will be live in 1-2 minutes! ⚡

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Railway (Recommended)
- **Free**: $5/month credit
- **Usage**: ~$2-3/month for this app
- **Verdict**: 2-3 months free, then $3/month

### Render
- **Free tier**: Always free
- **Limitations**: May sleep after 15 min inactivity
- **Verdict**: Free forever, but slower cold starts

### Vercel
- **Free tier**: Very generous limits
- **Perfect for**: Frontend deployment
- **Verdict**: Likely free forever

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Application Error" or 500 Error
1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Check deployment logs for errors
3. Ensure `VITE_FRED_API_KEY` is set

### App is slow to load
- This is normal for free tiers (cold starts)
- App will be fast once it "warms up"
- Consider upgrading to paid tier for instant loading

### API calls failing
1. Check FRED API key is valid
2. Test API directly: `/api/health`
3. Check CORS settings in production

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Choose your platform** (Railway recommended)
2. **Get your FRED API key**
3. **Deploy and test**
4. **Share the URL** with anyone who needs access
5. **Bookmark on your phone** for easy access

Your Bond Dashboard will now be accessible 24/7 from anywhere in the world! 🌍
