Browser Automation Scraping Methods

This package contains extractors that use browser automation for complex
scraping scenarios requiring JavaScript execution or advanced interactions:

- nodriver_extractor: Primary browser extractor using nodriver (undetected Chrome)
- playwright_extractor: Cross-browser extractor using Playwright
- selenium_extractor: Legacy browser extractor using Selenium

These extractors handle dynamic content, complex user interactions,
and scenarios where HTTP requests alone are insufficient.
