How to Read Market Signals
Understanding Your Bond Dashboard
This dashboard transforms 12 key bond market metrics into 5 clear signals that help you understand what's happening in fixed income markets and the broader economy. Think of it as your bond market translator – taking complex data and making it actionable.

The 12 Market Metrics
Treasury Yields
2-Year, 10-Year, and 30-Year Treasury Yields
These are the interest rates the U.S. government pays to borrow money for different time periods.

2-Year: Reflects near-term Fed policy expectations
10-Year: The benchmark rate that influences mortgages and corporate borrowing
30-Year: Shows long-term economic and inflation expectations

Higher yields = Stronger growth or inflation expectations
Lower yields = Economic concerns or flight to safety
Yield Curve Spreads
10Y-2Y Spread and 30Y-10Y Spread
These measure the difference between long and short-term rates.

Positive spread: Normal - investors demand more yield for longer-term loans
Near zero: Uncertainty about the future
Negative (inverted): Warning sign - often precedes recessions

The shape of the yield curve is one of the most reliable economic predictors.
Market Context Indicators
S&P 500, VIX, and Dollar Index
These provide crucial context for understanding bond movements:

S&P 500: When stocks fall, bonds often rally (flight to safety)
VIX: The "fear gauge" - high VIX often means bond buying
Dollar Index: Strong dollar attracts foreign investment to U.S. bonds

Policy Rates
Fed Funds Rate and SOFR
These are the short-term rates that anchor the entire rate structure:

Fed Funds: The Federal Reserve's main policy tool
SOFR: The market-based funding rate

When these rise, all rates tend to follow.
Credit Spreads
Investment Grade (IG) and High Yield (HY) Spreads
These measure the extra yield investors demand for corporate bonds over Treasuries:

Tight spreads: Confidence in corporate health
Wide spreads: Concern about defaults and economic stress

Credit spreads often lead other indicators in signaling problems.

The 5 Market Signals
1. Economic Outlook
What it tells you: What bond markets expect for economic growth
Based on: All yield curve metrics
Time horizon: 6-18 months ahead

Strong Growth: Steep yield curve, optimistic outlook
Moderate Growth: Normal curve, steady expansion expected
Slowdown: Flattening curve, growth concerns emerging
Recession Risk: Inverted curve, significant downturn expected

2. Risk Environment
What it tells you: How stressed or calm markets are
Based on: Credit spreads, VIX, and stock market
Time horizon: Current conditions to 3 months

Risk-On: Tight spreads, low volatility, calm markets
Balanced: Normal stress levels
Cautious: Spreads widening, volatility rising
Risk-Off: High stress, flight to quality

3. Policy & Rates Direction
What it tells you: Where interest rates are headed
Based on: Fed Funds, SOFR, 2Y and 10Y yields
Time horizon: 3-12 months

Easing Expected: Market pricing in rate cuts
Neutral: Rates expected to stay steady
Tightening Expected: Rate hikes anticipated

The gap between 2Y yields and Fed Funds shows what the market expects the Fed to do.
4. Bond Market Stress
What it tells you: Whether bond markets are functioning normally
Based on: Extreme readings across multiple indicators
Time horizon: Immediate
This signal counts "red flags" like curve inversions, spread blowouts, and funding stress. More red flags = higher risk of market disruption.
5. Inflation Expectations
What it tells you: What markets expect for future inflation
Based on: Long-term yields and curve steepness
Time horizon: 2-10 years

Low Inflation: Long yields below 3%
Normal: Long yields in historical ranges
Elevated: Rising long-term yields signal inflation concerns


Reading the Signals
Confidence Levels
Each signal comes with a confidence indicator:

High: All indicators agree
Moderate: Most indicators align
Low: Mixed or conflicting signals

When Signals Disagree
Sometimes signals conflict – this is valuable information:

Economic Outlook bearish but Risk Environment calm? Markets may be complacent
Rates Direction up but Bond Stress high? Fed may need to pause

Rate of Change Matters
It's not just the level, but the speed of change:

Rapid moves signal urgent shifts in sentiment
Gradual changes suggest orderly transitions

Using Signals Together
The signals work best as a system:

Check Economic Outlook for the big picture
Use Risk Environment for timing
Consider Policy Direction for rate exposure
Monitor Bond Stress for warning signs
Watch Inflation Expectations for long-term positioning
